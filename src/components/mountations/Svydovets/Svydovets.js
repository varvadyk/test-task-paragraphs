<MountainContent>The Svidovets ridge, or as it is also called, the Svidovets massif, is one of the most beautiful and long ridges in the Ukrainian Carpathians. It stretches for 60 km between the towns of Rakhiv and Ust-Cherna with the highest peak, Mount Bliznitsa, 1881 m high. Apart from the Dragobrat ski resort and the well-known Dogyaska lake, you will rarely meet people there. And if you come in July or August, you will be able to eat plenty of berries in the endless glades of blueberries.</MountainContent>
