<MountainContent>Eco trail to the Molochniy Kamin cave is located in the Carpathian Biosphere Reserve and starts from the Velyka Ugolka village. We walked along the trail with the group, but you can visit it on your own. There is a small entrance fee, buy tickets at the small house near the beginning of the route.
This is a really unique place. It's hard to get here, the road is terrible, and during a year the trail is visited only by several thousands of tourists. The vertical drop is 400 meters. Make sure you take a flashlight to inspect the cave; without it you won't be able to see the beautiful streams of limestone, which gave the cave its name. There is a secret passage in the cave that is not easy to find: it leads to the second floor and ends with another room, but we were not trying to get there. The total length of the cave is 92 meters.
