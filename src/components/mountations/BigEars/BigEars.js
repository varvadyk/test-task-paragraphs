<MountainContent>Eared Stone is a mountain in the Ukrainian Carpathians, in the Montenegrin massif. It is located in the Verkhovyna district of Ivano-Frankivsk region, within the Carpathian National Nature Park.

The height of the mountain is 1864 m. It lies in the south-eastern part of Montenegro, on one of the slopes of Mount Smotrych, which extends to the north and descends into the valley of the village of Dzembroni. At the top of the Eared Stone and its slopes there are bizarrely shaped rocks, which are popularly called "churches". The trail from Dzembroni to the main ridge of Montenegro passes through the top.

To the south-west of Vuhaty Kamen is the summit of Smotrych, and to the north-east (in the hollow) are the Dzembron Falls.</MountainContent>
