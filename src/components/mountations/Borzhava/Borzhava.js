<MountainContent>Polonyna Borzhava is a mountain range on the Polonyna ridge in the Ukrainian Carpathians, between the rivers Vicha and Rika. It is located within the Volovets, Mizhhirya, Svalyava, Irshava and (partially) Khust districts of the Zakarpattia region.
On the southern slopes of the ridge originates the river Borzhava, which cuts through a wide valley in the Vygorlat-Gutynsky (Volcanic) ridge and flows into the Tisza. In the north and northeast Polonyna Borzhava borders on the Volovets-Mizhhirya peak.
