<MountainContent>Ukraine is known for its karst caves. The most popular among tourists, “The Cinderella” (also known as “The Emil Racovita”) cave is truly a unique natural wonder. The entrance to the cave is located on the territory of Moldova, in Criva village. However, the bulk of its underground tunnels (93 km) is located mostly on the territory of Ukraine.

Discovered in March 1977 by Chernivtsi speleologists headed by Professor V. Korzhyk, Cinderella cave turned out to be the third world’s largest karst cave in the world. Previously, it was completely flooded, but in the middle of the XX century, gypsum (plaster) production began and workers partially drained the cave. The cave has lakes (several dozen) with their own peculiar names: «Blue Lake», «Dinosaur Lake», 12-15m deep wells (a dozen), unique "clay” stalactites of black and red clay. Due to its large size, the cave is being studied until now with new levels and vaults being discovered every year.</MountainContent>
